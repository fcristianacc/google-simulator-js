# Google Home Page

This is an application in React which simulates the initial page of Google.

My main goal is to learn this framework and get skills in Javascript.

To run the application we need to have _node.js_ and _npm_ installed and run the command `npm start` inside the project directory.

Finally, we simply go to the http://localhost:3000/ to access the fake Google (hehe) and enjoy it!
